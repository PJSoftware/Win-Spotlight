# Win-Spotlight
Automate copying of Windows Spotlight images into Wallpaper Folder

The first version of this will be in Perl, because I want to get it working quickly. At some point I shall probably convert it to a compiled language.

The task is simple:
* Look in the deeply nested Assets folder.
* Examine all files therein.
* Identify which ones are actually JPGs.
* Filter to only include the wallpaper-sized photos.
* Compare these with the ones already in the Wallpaper folder.
* Copy across the ones we don't already have.

Seemples.
